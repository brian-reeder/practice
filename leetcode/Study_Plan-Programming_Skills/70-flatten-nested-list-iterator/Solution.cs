Description:
    You are given a nested list of integers nestedList. Each element is either
    an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.
    Implement an iterator to flatten it.

    Implement the NestedIterator class:
    * NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList) Initializes the iterator
        with the nested list nestedList.
    * int next() Returns the next integer in the nested list.
    * boolean hasNext() Returns true if there are still some integers in the
        nested list and false otherwise.

Constraints:
    * 1 <= nestedList.length <= 500
    * The values of the integers in the nested list is in the range [-10^6, 10^6].
