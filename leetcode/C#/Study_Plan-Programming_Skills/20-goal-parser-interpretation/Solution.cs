Description:
    You own a Goal Parser that can interpret a string command. The command 
    consists of an alphabet of "G", "()" and/or "(al)" in some order. The Goal
    Parser will interpret "G" as the string "G", "()" as the string "o", and 
    "(al)" as the string "al". The interpreted strings are then concatenated in
     the original order.

    Given the string command, return the Goal Parser's interpretation of command.
