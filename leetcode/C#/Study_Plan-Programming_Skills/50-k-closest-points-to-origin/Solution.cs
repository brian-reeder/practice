Description:
    Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on
    the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin
    (0, 0).

    The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance
    (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

    You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed
    to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Constraints:
    1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4
    -10^4 < xi, yi < 10^4
